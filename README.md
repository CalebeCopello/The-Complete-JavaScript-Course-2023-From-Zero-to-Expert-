### What is JavaScript

JavaScript can be defined as a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. OK... Fine, but what does it mean? Well, a programming language is a tool to construct some kind of layer between the hardware and the user, in other words, it's a set of instructions to make the computer do things. Taking this into account, we can also think about the high-level characteristic, it means that the language is closer to the user than to the hardware, differently from C for example, in JavaScript it's no need to manage memory. JavaScript is also an object-oriented language, instead of old paradigms like C that was an event oriented language. And it's multi-paradigm because it accepts many styles to structure the code.
